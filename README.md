# PIA

A series of convinience scripts for Private Internet Access.

## Updater

PIA, upon reconnect and port forwarding request, randomizes the forwarded port. This can be quite a pain when restarting networks / machines. This script runs on reboot, and updates the listening port on a qbittorrent client to the open PIA port.

## Requirements

-   PIA Subscription

-   Python 3.6+

-   requests

## Installation

**TODO**
